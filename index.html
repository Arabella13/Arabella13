            <h1>My Family</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">We are three siblings and my mothers name is Reychelle Abraham and the name of my father is Ariel Capacio.My family isquite complicated for some case because my father and my mother are separated in my childhood days due to family issues.That is why i am raised by my grandmother and grandfather and until now they are supporting me physically and financially in my studies.My mother recently died last september 18 2021 due to chronic lung disease and heart attack.Sadly we mourned so much to our mother and her memories to us will never be forgotten.We are so hurt since my mother died and left us thats why as an elder sister  to my two brothers I need to be strong and study well for me to help them and also my father.</p>
